# The reciprocal effect of value and arousal on conscious awareness in binocular rivalry taskThe effect of value and arousal on dominance in conscious visual awareness was tested in a series of three binocular rivalry experiments summarized here:* **Experiment 1** - Celebrities Faces* **Experiment 2** - Politicians Faces* **Experiment 3** - IAPS images (international affective picture system; Lang et al., 1997) ## Authors* **Tom Salomon**, *Department of Neurobiology, Tel Aviv University** **Yael Solar Priel**, *Department of Neurobiology, Sagol School of Neuroscience, School of Psychological Sciences, Tel Aviv University* * **Yarden Shir**, *Sagol School of Neuroscience, Tel Aviv University** **Keren Shoval**, *Sagol School of Neuroscience, Tel Aviv University** **Rinat Kiperman**, *Sagol School of Neuroscience, Tel Aviv University** **Liad Mudrik**, *Sagol School of Neuroscience, School of Psychological Sciences, Tel Aviv University** **Tom Schonberg**, *Sagol School of Neuroscience, Department of Neurobiology, Tel Aviv University*## In This Repository### BR Experiment directoriesIn each experiment directory you will find 3 folder:* BR_Data - Raw data from the binocular rivalry task* Behavioral_Data - Output from non-BR tasks, such as subjective value evaluation tasks* tmp_data - BR_Data read into MATLAB variables for fast and easy access.#### Missing data notes - Experiment 2 (Politicians)Some data files are missing from the BR_Politicians repository due to incompletion of the full task* Subject 034 - has no Subjective Arousal data file* Subjects: 056, 058 - has no Subjective Arousal and no subjective value data file* Subjects: 062, 068 - stopped before the experiment ended (no data)* Subjects: 052, 053, 057 - experiment BR_Politicians - had technical difficulties and were not run (no data)### Analysis directoryHere are the codes used to process the raw data, perform the main analysis (MATLAB) and some additional regression analysis (R)#### Pre-processing Codes:* Script1_merge_BR_data.m - Read raw BR data, merge into MATLAB temporary files and merge data for all subjects together into one table (saved in sub-directory 'processed data'). *This script was already run in the current repository*.* Script2_SubjectsValidity.m - Read merged data table created by script 1, generate lists of valid and invalid subject to be used by following codes (saved in sub-directory 'processed data'). *This script was already run in the current repository*.#### Analysis Codes:* Script3_personal_details_and_familiarity_exclusion.m - Descriptive statistics of the age and gender of valid subjects and exclusion criteria used to remove invalid subjects from following analyses.* Script4_BR_IAPS_permutation_analysis.m - Main statistical analysis. Examine dominance of high-value and/or high-arousal stimuli in the BR task.* Script4_v2_BR_IAPS_permutation_analysis_with_subjective_ratings.m - Same as script4, only removing trials in experiment 3 where subjective ratings did not match the experimental manipulation.* Script5_Exp3_power_analysis.m - Power analysis used to determine the minimal n for Experiment 3 (IAPS) using Experiment 2 (Politicians) data.* Script6_subjective_ratings_descriptive.m - descriptive statistic for the subjective rating tasks in Experiment 3.* BR_subjective_ratings_regression_analysis.R - Exploratory regression analyses accounting for subjective ratings of value and/or arousal.#### Dependencies* sign_flip_permutation_test.m - permutation test code.## LicenseThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) file for details.You are welcome to use the data and scripts published here for any purpose.
